                        Back in September, Laravel News partnered with LaraJobs to run a Laravel survey, to see what types of projects people are taking on with Laravel, as well as get some feedback on what the Laravel community could be doing better. With over 1,600 submissions, and some interesting insights, the complete results are available here.

                             Moving the Drupal 8 Workflow Initiative Along

                            Nine months ago I wrote about the importance of improving Drupal\'s content workflow capabilities and how we set out to include a common base layer of workflow-related functionality in Drupal 8 core. Today, I\'d like to provide an update on the workflow initiative\'s progress the past 9 months.

                            Unlike a scrum master, whose responsibilities are focused on the development team, a product owner has a shared responsibility to the team and to the customer. The product owner is the voice of the customer, and stands in as the representative of the customer?s needs, wants, and expectations.

                            At Larajobs we?ve been front and centre for the amazing rise in popularity in Laravel over the past few years. Each year it seems to keep growing faster than we could ever expect. Though we can all see the growth in Github stars or Google searches, we thought it?d be interesting to partner up with Laravel News to survey Laravel users, to dig out more details than you can get from those simpler metrics. Over 1,600 of you took the survey! Here we?ve published the results, along with some additional analytical analysis and a subset of the replies we received to the open ended questions.

                            Can you write me a simple script that fetches some information from an RSS feed and displays the titles? Like, just write me that script in a couple of minutes. I don\'t care about tests, quality, etc. Just get me the information, quickly.Â I\'m curious how you would handle this request. A couple of years ago I was asked a similar question. Not in a professional role, but for a hobby project that has nothing to do with PHP. There was a website, a simple website, and it needed some information displayed. Nothing fancy right? I can do that. But as I sat down to code this little script, I came to the conclusion that it took me way too much effort to start thinking in a pragmatic, simplistic way.

                            A few days ago I merged a patch into Xdebug that removes support for PHP 5 in Xdebug\'s master branch on GitHub. Maintaining PHP 5 and PHP 7 support in one code base is not particularly easy, and even more complicated for something like Xdebug, with its deep interactions with PHP\'s internals. As PHP 5.6\'s active support has ended on December 31st, I also felt it no longer needed to support PHP 5 with Xdebug any more. It saves more than 5000 lines of code.

                            In this Programming With Yii2 series, I\'m guiding readers in use of the Yii2 Framework for PHP. In today\'s tutorial, I\'ll review routing and URL creation in Yii. When a browser request arrives at your Yii application\'s index.php file, it must be parsed to determine which controller and method to call. That\'s routing. The reverse process of linking to parts of your application is URL creation, which is best done programmatically.

                            Part of our work is defensive programming. A lot of web development is centered around taking input from a customer, processing it in some way and returning output. Since the source of input is out of our control we are used to writing all kinds of guards. Is this an integer (in case of a dynamically typed language), is it greater than zero, is it smaller than RANDOM_THRESHOLD, etc.

                            I recently came across the Phive project and have had a play with it. Phive is part of phar.io and is intended to manage development tools such as PHPUnit in preference to using Composer\'s dev dependencies. The main advantages of Phive are that it uses the phar file of the tool and only keeps one copy of each version rather than downloading a new copy into each project.

                            Recently a former colleague of mine, Lucas van Lierop, showed me his new website, which he created using Spress. Lucas took two bold moves: he started freelancing, and he open-sourced his website code. This to me was very inspiring. I\'ve been getting up to speed with Docker recently and am planning to do a lot more with it over the coming months, and being able to take a look at the source code of up-to-date projects that use Docker is certainly invaluable. Taking lots of inspiration from Lucas\'s codebase, and after several hours of fiddling with configuration files, I can now guide you through the steps it took to containerise my blog (which is the site you\'re visiting now) and deploy a single container to a production server.

                            As our applications become more complex ? with Composer dependencies, Webpack build scripts, and per-environment variables ? we inevitably reach a point where testing all of these different intricacies becomes slow and laborious, especially when you?re tearing down and rebuilding the entire environment for each test. Likewise, code style might deviate over time and creating a production ready deployment archive requires a specific set of steps to be followed.

                            . In that series, we created a WP-CLI package that helps with installing and uninstalling WordPress development environments, and we even got it submitted to the WP-CLI Package Index. Since the command is available for anyone to use in the Package Index, it makes sense to improve on the command and make sure that it works for everyone. In this post we?re going to take a bit of a break from automating WordPress installs and start writing some functional tests to make sure that everything works as expected. While I?ll be writing the tests for the wp installer command, the same concepts should apply for any WP-CLI package.

                            This is another security tip to harden your WordPress site running on IIS server. As we know, hackers always try to find loop holes in the website to hack it. It is better to prepare yourself for each type of attack. A smart developer always tries to minimise the chances of hacking by implementing security measures. Attack on upload folder by inserting .php files to it is one of the most used hacking technique. Hackers generally insert a PHP file to your upload folder and execute it to get useful information or delete something.

                            Timeouts are a rarely discussed topic and neglected in many applications, even though they can have a huge effect on your site during times of high load and when dependent services are slow. For micro service architectures timeouts are important to avoid cascading failures when a service is down.

                            Guzzle has become the de-facto HTTP-client library for PHP. But recently a number of open source projects have been switching to HTTPlug which boasts itself as an HTTP-client abstraction. We chat about the problems HTTPlug aims to solve, the plans for its future and the reasons behind why some library maintainers have chosen to adopt it or not.

If you love technical writing, technical documentation, and documenting your code, then this is an episode you?re not going to want to miss. Dan shares so much valuable insight into why Asciidoc is the premiere format for writing, regardless of the type of work you do, how the format came to life, some of the tooling available, plus so much more. If you?re just getting in to technical writing, love documenting your code, but want to spend less time doing it, or just want to find a toolchain that demands less of you, but gives you so much more, then grab your favourite beverage, put your feet up, and tune in!

From here we move on to chat about working on a product vs. working in an agency setting, picking your battles when refactoring and not being scared to make mistakes. Finally, we highlight how Edd has recently used personal Homebrew taps, using Android simulators for testing and Lew?s experience with Vue.js.

                            Welcome to the very first episode of 2017! We?re back after a nice break for the holidays and ready to get back to being insightful and unfiltered. In this episode we talked about the concept of ?programming as craft? with Chris and Ed having a great discussion about what should follow after the phrase ?programmers need to learn empathy.? Ed also released some music, and is donating all the proceeds to OSMI. Chris was sad that he did not get the opportunity to re-record the vocal tracks from some of Ed?s older material in his own signature vocal style. Chris also talked (not so briefly) about the new laptop he bought and the security measures he decided to take with it.

These may be well-known design patterns, fundamental concepts, or novel applications of a familiar tool. At some point, if you haven?t already, you?ll realise a little planning and learning how others have solved a problem can go a long way. You?ll see failure cases you may not have considered, or you?ll find an approach that is easier to maintain or scales faster.
