                    <br/>
                    Two more announcements from the PHP development team this week see the immediate release of PHP 5.5.5 and PHP 5.4.21.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Nomad PHP announces its guest speakers for the November presentations, in Europe and the states.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    We hear from Michael Wallner of SmugMug, giving advice to budding PHP developers, drawing on his 10+ years experience of PHP.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    We also have the latest podcast from PHP Town Hall, discussing the difference between PHP?s organisational structure and lack of BDFL with that of Rails, or Linux, plus a little about service-orientated architecture.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Got an opinion? We\'d love to hear it so drop me an email.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Cheers

                     Talk PHP With The Experts: The Transcript

                    <br/>
                    Sarah Hawk writes - Talk with the Experts this morning was a busy one, with close to a record number of attendees. Hardly surprising really, considering that the subject was PHP. Luckily for me, the experts were our very own developers Jude Aakjaer and Michael Sauter and they were super quick off the mark. I didn?t even have to queue the questions. Too easy. The thing that excited me the most about the chat was that we finally got to use the code window that I commissioned months ago and it was a huge success. If you read through the transcript below, you?ll see the code saved to Gists throughout the dialogue.

Since musketeers.me first acquired php[architect] at the beginning of 2013, it is the one question that we have constantly been asked. While digital publishing is the future, people still love the feeling of having a printed magazine in hand. Knowing that our customers wanted it, we?ve worked hard to figure out a way that we could bring the magazine back to print again. We are extremely excited today to announce that starting with the November 2013 issue, php[architect] will once again be printed!

Everyone notices that the conference runs smoothly, is a lot of fun to attend and everyone learns heaps. That is certainly no accident. Let me give you a peek into the scheduling process. Use this timetable as a reference when you read the rest of the article.

                    Brandon Savage has a new post talking about the value of design patterns with his response to another post. He tries to put the emphasis back on making good OOP code instead of worrying too much about the actual design pattern. He relates design patterns to the sentence structures you learn when learning a new (spoken) language. He suggests that, while they\'re a good way for developers to communicate, they shouldn\'t be the only emphasis. When a developer becomes more fluent in a language, the patterns should become less important but are still a good structure for good development practices.

                    In Volker Dusch\'s latest post he makes a suggestion to the PHP community as a whole - stop pretending PHP is a good language and admit its flaws where it has them. He gets into some of the "it\'s not okay when..." kinds of things that PHP allows and also suggests a few things that you can do to help the situation, including not sending angry emails to the internal mailing list and contribute back with something useful instead (like RFCs).

He uses Doctrine to manage the database entities/repositories and includes the code to create them. Finally Ren makes the views and templates for this first route and shows the end result.

But what comes next is using a programming language like PHP to connect directly from a website to our noSQL database server. In this tutorial I will go through the steps you need to run to install MongoDB PHP extension on debian / Ubuntu operating system.

                     On the Aura blog Paul Jones has posted a look ahead for the framework, looking specifically at what\'s coming in version 2 for the Aura.Sql and ExtendedPdo functionality. He gives the example of Aura.Sql compared to the Solar_Sql (from the Solar framework) and how certain things that they thought needed to be coupled actually didn\'t. In version 2 of the Aura.Sql component they\'re taking this same approach and abstracting out things that don\'t actually need to be in the base class. This breaks it up into three packages - Aura.Sql-v2, Aura.Sql_Query and Aura.Sql_Schema. He gets into more detail in the rest of the post as to what the new Aura.Sql (v2) will still handle.

                     Wojciech Sznapka has an interesting post on his site talking about injecting repositories into services in Symfony2-based applications. By injecting just a single repository instead of the entire EntityManager, you get a cleaner, more clear interface defined in the code. He includes some code to illustrate his point - both a "services.xml" configuration of the related dependency injection container and a custom entity repository (defined in the config). He then shows how this repository (FooRepository) would be injected into the service (FooService) via constructor injection.

                     Russell Walker has written a post comparing two popular methods for abstracting out database access and working with your data - the Active Record and Data Mapper patterns for data persistence. He gives simple code examples of both - one showing a basic "save" call with Active Record and the other showing the saving of a "Foo" entity using similar logic. Along with these examples he includes a few points about the major advantages and disadvantages related to the pattern. He also talks some about "service objects", the go-between that the data mapper pattern uses to combine business logic and the mapper object. He ends the post by making some suggestions about which to use, depending on the need of course.

Parse.com?s javascript API, the documentation is very good and it will help you to start your project in no time. Besides diving into the details, let me highlight another cool feature of Parse.com API - the user management. Sign up someone, or let someone sign in, validate their email? Everything is there!

                     Digital goods are an increasingly valuable commodity. Whether you\'re a designer selling templates or font files, a developer charging for packages of code or a musician selling MP3s, selling digital goods online is often far easier than physical goods ? with much lower production costs and no delivery charges. In this article, Lukas White shows how you can implement a simple store selling digital goods using PHP along with Stripe, a payment provider who aims to make it easier than ever to take online payments since you don\'t need to set up special merchant accounts or deal with complex payment gateways.

Using memcached server to cache such data will drastically improve performance and speed your website by at least by 50%.

                    Ed Finkler presents More Code, More Problems. In this talk I?ll extend the concepts to other languages we work with in web development, establishing these core principles: Learn languages, not frameworks, Build small things, less code is better than more, Create and use simple, readable code. We?ll cover how following these principles makes you a better developer and makes the job of maintaining and verifying your code much easier.

                    On 7PHP.com another community interview has been posted - this time it\'s with Michael Wallner, a full-time PHP core developer working at SmugMug. He answers questions about his past, how he started with PHP and what he thinks of the language now versus when he started out with it. He gives some advice to budding PHP developers and some of the libraries/projects he suggests. They then talk some about his work at SmugMug and how much time he\'ll be spending dedicated to working on the PHP core.

                     SAP Developers Guide to PHP (by Craig Cmehil, published 20th October 2013)

                    With growing interest in the development of low cost development solutions in a corporate environment, PHP is becoming more and more popular. However, the biggest problem for most SAP developers is the need for quick information to help them hit the ground running. This book provides readers with a comprehensive assessment of what is really needed to work with PHP, as well as how the SAP and PHP systems work together. After a short introduction to PHP and its capability characteristics, the SAPRFC extension module for PHP 4 and PHP 5 is explained in detail. Working with a sample application, you will learn how the two systems communicate with one another and how best to use PHP for your own SAP-related development projects.

                    Requests is a stable PHP library that uses cURL or fsockopen (depending on the availability) and provides a consistent API. It simplifies sending requests, accepts HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE or PATCH and adding headers, form data + multipart files. The library also works with international domain names, authentication, auto-decompressing gzipped responses and much more. To sum up, Requests is a must-bookmark for easy-to-use and hosting-friendly HTTP requests.

                    Munee is an all-in-one library that handles many things related to optimisation and manipulation of website assets. The library has a powerful caching feature that can cache resources in both server and client-side. It integrates well with the PHP image manipulation library: Imagine for resizing or cropping images (and caching them afterwards). Munee can automatically compile LESS, SCSS and CoffeeScript and it can combine CSS + JS files into a single request. Also, these CSS-JS files can be minified for a better performance. This PHP library integrates to any code easily with less effort and it can be used with or without .htaccess (good for Windows users).

                    Swift Mailer is a feature-rich PHP mailer library for sending e-mails from PHP websites and applications. It does not rely on PHP?s native mail() class which consumes high resources. Instead, Swift communicates directly with an SMTP server or a MTA binary to send mail quickly and efficiently. Swift supports event-driven plugins which offer you the opportunity to really take control of the library and set this mailer apart from everything else that?s out there.

                    Image Cache is a lightweight PHP class that compresses, moves and caches the image in the user?s browser. After that, it returns the new source of the image to be printed in an image tag which results in a serious gain on load time. The class works by simply setting options like the directory, the base URL, etc. and calling a compress function for each image.

                    A PHP collection library loosely inspired by the .NET runtime and the C++ STL. PHP has long been lacking formal, performant collection types. The addition of the heap-centric collections to the SPL has gone some way to addressing this problem but has fallen short in some regards.
