                    Following last weeks malware issues on php.net, is PHP really secure?

                     Is PHP Secure?

                    In a classic watering hole attack, hackers compromised php.net last week, a well-known, respected high-traffic website and planted malware in a bid to infect unsuspecting visitors. On Oct. 24, Google began to flag php.net as being a site hosting malware, i.e., potentially a watering hole. According to PHP.net, malware was served to "a small percentage" of users between Oct. 22 and Oct. 24. That\'s a very big deal with huge implications. Is PHP itself now at risk? What about all the people who visit php.net?

                    Paul Jones has an interesting post on his site talking about how your "framework of choice" will eventually fail even if there is long term support for it. He points to another article about trial and error and emphasises that (as Richard Feynman has said) failures are just as important as successes. Paul goes on to talk about the usefulness of stepping outside of your norm - your framework of choice - and getting a wider perspective on how others do things.

                     On the Google Cloud Platform blog there\'s a recent post showing you how to directly integrate the Google App Engine PHP support with the popular PHP IDE PhpStorm for seamless development. His example shows how to integrate the IDE with the Google Cloud SQL service. He shows how to create a new user (via the API console) and how to connect that user in PhpStorm. He includes a CREATE statement for a sample table and the PHP code to connect.

                     The ServerGrove blog continues their spotlight on the various components that make up the Symfony2 framework in their latest post about the EventDispatcher. The post includes a brief introduction to the Mediator design pattern and how the EventDispatcher implements it. Sample code is included showing how to make a dispatcher, add events and dispatch an event to a waiting listener. There\'s also a comparison between "event listeners" and "event subscribers", pointing out that the latter has more flexibility when it comes to event priority.

                     Hasin Hayder has posted a guide to getting a Symfony2 application up and running in an OpenShift instance. OpenShift is a cloud hosting service that makes deploying and scaling applications simpler. He shows you how to set up a Zend Server (5.6) instance and grab the repository through a git checkout. The commands to create a new Symfony2 application (via Composer) are also included. With a small change to the .gitignore, the needed configuration files and directories will no longer be ignored and will be pushed. There\'s also a bit of information about setting up and using the provided database instance.

OpenShift is RedHat\'s platform as a service that makes it easier to set up and deploy web apps. This repository helps you set up the Symfony instance that\'s ready to go. He walks you through the steps you\'ll need to create the OpenShift "gear" and configure it to work with Symfony and MySQL.

                     Chris Hartjes, testing guru, has a post talking about using arrays in data providers for your unit tests. More specifically about some odd behavior one developer was seeing in their tests. The issue (example code included) was in how the data providers are expecting the data to be returned. His test was expecting an array but the data provider was returning things incorrectly. As Chris points out, the provider should return an array of arrays. The fix is easy, but could be confusing to someone not used to this slightly unusual return format.

                     <br/>
                     Accessing private class properties via getters and setters is a pretty standard way to write your applications. Unfortunately it can be time consuming to write them for every property your class may have. On 7PHP.com Khayrattee Wasseem has a few ideas (including using PHP\'s own Reflection functionality) to dynamically create them. He shows two different methods to accomplish this kind of dynamic access, one using traits and the other using normal class inheritance. Also included is the code illustration for each solution and he talks a bit at the end of each section about why that method might be better than the other.

In this new tutorial they build on the basics from part one to briefly discuss controllers and the Eloquent ORM. They explain some of the basics of controllers first including a bit of sample code showing how to output a basic view and add a new route. Following that is a brief look at using the ORM and making a model - a Post - and defining the table it relates to.

                     Posted on the YourHowTo tutorial website this week - Encryption is the basic of them all when it comes to security. In basic scripting md5 is the easiest basic method of encryption. A lot of developers use this for basic protection, including wordpress developers for their passwords. I confirmed this today when a client of mine was having issues with his access in his wordpress blog. Well anyway, in this article I?m going to show you some easy encryption methods using php.

This article shows you how you can install this web server on linux Ubuntu / Debian operating systems. There is no repository needed for Lighttpd so you just need to proceed and run the command.

                     On the Qandidate.com blog there\'s a new post showing you an easy way to debug HHVM applications via the built-in debugging tool and it\'s command line interface. The HHVM is the virtual machine version of the HipHop compiler Facebook created to speed up PHP execution. To illustrate, they create a super simple PHP script and show how to start up the HHVM in debug mode. They introduce you to the commands you\'ll need to step through the script execution and locate the breakpoints where errors are happening. You can do things like print out the current values of variables, set conditional breakpoints and get a stack trace for the execution so far.

                    CodeConnexx is a two-day, one track conference that aims to bring together everyone interested in talking about code. As we know, choosing a career as a coder comes with its own set of life challenges and we want to talk about those too. In short, this conference is a different kind of conference, as it connects those two pieces of the puzzle together in one event. Every technical talk will be followed by a talk about life skills and work/life balance. There will also be plenty of social opportunities to get to know the other attendees. Not only do we want to help you bridge the gap between work and life, we want to help you connect with each other as well. CodeConnexx, hosted by PHPWomen, will take place in Maastricht, Netherlands on November 8th &amp; 9th 2013. We sincerely hope you are able to join us.

                    Cal Evans has a new post on his site about a book he\'s published covering a topic not really focused on in the PHP world - command-line usage. The book, "Signaling PHP" covers the use of the process control extension to handle command-line signals. The eBook is available for purchase and download now at a suggested price of only $5 USD. If you\'ve been looking for a quick, concise guide to using process control in PHP, you should check it out.

It has a huge library of devices (including Nook, Nexus, Kindle, Archos..) and browsers for a stable detection.

                     The Slash Programming Language
                    </a>
                    <br/>
                    Slash is a new programming language for the web. It is mainly inspired by Ruby and PHP, with hints of Python and Perl. PHP is a great tool that is virtually unmatched in its domain - ie. ?slap a script on a server and have it run?. The problem is that PHP?s idiosyncrasies make it awkward and sometimes even painful to program in. Slash combines PHP?s simple execution model with the elegance of Ruby?s object model. The result is a language that lets you achieve results quickly while being a joy to use.
